Course Review Database
======================

This is intended to be used by the UMD International Education Office to replace the current course equivalency process currently in place.

The idea is not to radically rethink the way we do or search for course reviews, but to replace the current system, which involves many separate steps and several Excel files and is prone to breaking.

###Getting Started
